# Adding Users Using React

### This is a my first React App created by using create-react-app tool

In this app, I tested some of basic react concepts along with other concepts that are directly, or indirectly related to React

---

I built my app using:

- React useState hook
- Using JSX Syntax
- ES6 syntax of JaveScript to export and import components and other files
- Array methods to manipulate the data
- props to transfer data from parent component to children and vice versa
- SASS for comfortable designing
- CSS modules for using conditional styling
- Conditionals to output data according to user's input
- Error messages
